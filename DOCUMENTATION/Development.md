# MWOSD GUI

## Build Requirements

If you plan to compile the MWOSD GUI on your system, you will need the following
installed.

 - [Processing PDE 2.2.1](https://processing.org/download/?processing) (latest Processing 2 at time of writing, Processing 3 has
   incompatibilities)
 - [controlP5-2.0.4](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive-downloads/v2/code.google.com/controlp5/controlP5-2.0.4.zip)

The controlP5 library should be extracted into your `$HOME/sketchbook/libraries`
directory. It should be contained within it's own subdirectory `controlP5`. You
must restart Processing in order for the library to be loaded.
